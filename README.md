# Air Quality Monitoring Stations Network in France

## Description

This project provides an interactive dashboard to explore air quality monitoring stations in France. The dashboard visualizes the spatial distribution of monitoring stations, analyzes the typology of areas covered, and explores the evolution of the network over time. It also assesses data quality by evaluating missing values in key variables.

## Features

- **Interactive Map**: Visualizes the geographic distribution of stations, colored by area type (urban, suburban, rural).
- **Typology & Municipalities**: Displays insights into the area types covered by stations and the municipalities with the most stations.
- **History**: Displays the evolution of the number of stations installed over the years.
- **Data Quality**: Analyzes the missing data rates for key variables such as latitude, longitude, and activity dates.
